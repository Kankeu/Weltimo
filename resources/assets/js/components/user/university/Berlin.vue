                Berlin is comprised of twelve districts. Berliners often call them their “Kiez”, meaning the small area inside a city quarter, the immediate vicinity. The Neukölln district, for example, is as large as the entire city of Mannheim.
            </p>
            <p>
                Berlin is very green. Numerous parks, gardens and lakes are close by and distinctly influence the look of the city. The flea markets are popular and the list of activities is endless. Many people are enchanted by the city and its particular rhythm. The interaction of various cultures is enriching and strongly shapes the city’s unique character. Berlin is also a presentation venue for young artists. Approximately 15 percent of the city’s inhabitants are foreigners.

                You will find students throughout the entire city. Some choose to live near their universities, while others consciously decide not to. The availability of student accommodation is as variable as the city itself. Rental prices have increased rapidly in recent years. Certain districts like Kreuzberg and Neukölln have become more and more popular. Many students tend to live in districts where fellow students also live. Much of life takes place in the immediate vicinity of one’s flat. In this regard, Berlin is not your typical university town. If the enormous size of the city makes you feel overwhelmed, the universities offer advising programmes for international students which can help you get acclimated faster.

                Despite its size, you’ll find your way around Berlin quickly because its infrastructure is rather straightforward. Public transportation is the best way to get from place to place. You can travel everywhere within city limits for free with your semester ticket. In fact, the Berlin Public Transportation Authority clocks up so many kilometres that its trains could travel 16 times around the earth – every day! If you happen to live far away from your university, you might have to take an hour-long train ride to get to classes.

                Berlin is a green city. There are countless parks, each with its own unique atmosphere. The Mauerpark, for example, is famous for its flea market and karaoke events. If you need to escape the hectic pace of life in Berlin, you don’t have to go far. There are R&R areas at numerous swimming lakes in Berlin.

                Operas, concerts, plays, varieté shows, poetry slams, readings, street festivals – there are so many things to do, which this event calendar can verify. There are many days when museums offer free admission or cinemas offer concession rates. As a student, you’re almost always eligible for concession rates on tickets, e.g. at theatres like the “Berliner Ensemble”and the Schaubühne. Some movie theatres, which also show independent films, offer lower-priced subscription rates.

                faced with countless possibilities. Life in Berlin is fast-paced, and so is its nightlife. What all your friends were raving about last year might be yesterday’s news today. Beach bars, festivals, open air concerts (even in the winter) are always popular. There’s a club in Berlin for every possible taste in music. However, Berlin is actually well-known for its electronic music scene.

                As far as food is concerned, you can find everything your taste buds desire and your budget can afford. Two great places to go are Markthalle Neun and the Thai Meadow in the Preussenpark. If you’re looking for fresh vegetables and spices, go to the weekly markets, such as the one on Maybachufer. Berliners like meeting on Sundays for brunch at one of the many cafés in town. There are affordable places to eat in almost every street – and you can order everything to go. Curried sausages and doner kebabs are two typical and well-loved specialities. If you want some variety and don’t have very much to spend, the student dining halls are a good alternative.

                Its diversity. You can simply discover so much here. There’s always something going on and it’s affordable. Every “Kiez” is different. My advice is to check out what’s going on, go to the parks and enjoy life in Berlin to its fullest.

        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                I’ve been here for six years now. Many Nepalese go to America or Australia – that’s also what I had originally planned to do. Especially because of the language. But then my uncle, who lives here, convinced me to come to Germany instead. There are no tuition fees here and living expenses are lower than in other countries. I attended an intensive German language course and then continued learning on my own. My uncle’s wife can’t speak a word of Nepalese so I had to immediately speak German. Of course, everything was strange at first. People had to show me how to eat here, how to go shopping, how to use public transportation.

                First of all, my family. And then the fact that I moved into a student hall of residence. And the German-Nepalese Society. There are many associations of this kind which host traditional events where you can meet people. I also worked at a small restaurant. I’m still very close with the people there. And then, five years ago, I met my present boyfriend.

                Basically you spend all your time together because you hardly ever leave campus. It’s practically impossible not to meet people, because in Ilmenau, you feel like a big family.
