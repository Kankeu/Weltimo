        <v-card-title><h3>Why did you decide to study and live in Ilmenau?</h3></v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                I absolutely wanted to study Mechatronics, and back in 2006, there were only three universities in Germany that offered such a programme. I was accepted at both Ilmenau and Nuremberg. After getting my admission letter from Ilmenau, I originally planned to start a German course there and then transfer to Nuremberg later. It turned out that I liked it here so much that I stayed. Generally, I decided to study in Germany because it has a great reputation worldwide when it comes to Engineering programmes.

        <v-card-title><h3>How did you find accommodation? What advice can you give other students who are looking for a place to stay?</h3></v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                The Studentenwerk gladly helps you look for an adequate room in a student residence hall in the beginning. I myself lived in a room in a residence hall on campus for seven years. I paid 200 euros a month for a 24-m2 room. For the past year, I’ve been living in a flat-share in Ilmenau, which is, of course, a bit more expensive.

        <v-card-title><h3>What are you favourite places in Ilmenau?</h3></v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                You have to admit that Ilmenau is a pretty small town, but yet it has everything you need. They have a really nice swimming pool and you don’t have to go far to do some hiking in the forest.
            </p>
        </v-card-text>
        <v-card-title><h3>What’s the best way of coming in contact with other students?</h3></v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                Basically you spend all your time together because you hardly ever leave campus. It’s practically impossible not to meet people, because in Ilmenau, you feel like a big family.

        <v-card-title><h3>Describe Germany in three words.</h3></v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>
                1. Open – by which I mean the support and opportunities which Germany offers foreign students.
                <br>2. Reliable – Germany offers many possibilities and a pleasant atmosphere for foreign students, and since they changed the visa laws, you can concentrate better on your studies and take the time you need.
                <br>3. Quality – that is, the good quality of education that exists in Germany.
